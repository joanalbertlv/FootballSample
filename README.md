FootballSample
==============

Simple football game to show some physics.
The game is strongly based on "Soccer Physics" with a few modifications. I have changed some values of friction, density, etc. in order to make the game funnier.
If you want to kick the ball, touch the screen. 
If you drag the finger over the screen, the player will move in the direction specified.

I have included all the necessary files to compile the project (I used Android Development Tools), and also an apk file in the "bin" folder.

I tried to create a game that has all the desired features. As I am currently working and I do not have too much time, I have not had time to include other features to improve the game: more intelligence, better graphics, etc. In case it is needed, I can keep working on this project for more days.

I hope you enjoy it!
